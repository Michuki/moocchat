Question.create(text:"Wolves can double their numbers every year. They do not do so, however, if the area in which they live is already full and the territory of each pack borders on the territory of other packs on all sides. Lone wolves, unable to establish a territory near their place of origin, disperse to a less desirable habitat and often are hunted by people. Which of the following conclusions may be properly drawn from the information in the passage above?",answers: ['The number of wolves in any area suitable for wolves may be predicted to quadruple in two years.', 'Wolves are ejected from the pack to wander singly as lone wolves when the number of wolves in the pack has doubled.', 'The amount of territory suitable for wolves has been diminishing in recent years as a result of human encroachment, with a resulting diminution in the wolf population.', 'Wolf hunting can continue at a moderate rate on the fringes of a good habitat for wolves without a decrease in the average yearly wolf population in that territory.', 'The wolf population density in a given area of wolf territory does not vary with the yearly rate of wolf reproduction.'],correct_answer_index: 3)
Question.create(text:"The TJ-700 and the Beta Turbomax are two models of cars of different manufacturers.  These two models have almost identical specifications and features, and they sell for almost the same price.

In the past five years, the total number of TJ-700's sold is about 80% greater than the total number of Beta Turbomax's sold.

Question.create(text:"The Food and Drug Administration Agency’s latest research has just been released. Studies conducted on laboratory rats demonstrate that when pregnant rats are given doses of caffeine equivalent to a human consumption of six cups of coffee per day, the rate of birth defects increases.

The government’s position on requiring warning labels on caffeinated products most strongly suggests which of the following?",answers: ["concern about imposing a warning that applies only to part of the population", "a reluctance to impose a warning when limited consumption may be harmless", "doubts about the conclusive nature of the studies", "a reluctance to draw conclusions about human birth defects from studies on animals", "doubts about the seriousness of the birth defects"],correct_answer_index: 2)

Question.create(text:"Tests demonstrating that the olfactory bulbs (relating to the sense of smell) of salmon will react upon exposure only to water from their spawning ground and no other water suggest the possibility that repeated exposure to a specific odorant of their spawning area during the first few weeks of life could stimulate olfactory receptor sites, increasing olfactory sensitivity to that single scent and influencing salmon migration to their spawning area. Which of the following statements, if true, would seriously weaken the author’s conclusion?",answers: ["Salmon have been trained, through repeated exposure, to recognize phenol and distinguish it from closely related pchlorphenol, in concentrations as small as five parts per billion.", "A dog can detect and distinguish the odor of a single human fingerprint for as long as six weeks, after which time the scent usually fades away.", "Salmon have been successfully stocked in rivers where special salmon \"runs\" have been constructed.", "Women are acutely aware of the odor of a synthetic steroid named exaltolide, which most men are unable to detect.", "Salmon spawned and raised in hatcheries will return to the spawning ground of their parents, and not to the source of the water (the hatcheries) in which they were spawned."],correct_answer_index: 4)

Question.create(text:"Epidemiologist: Malaria passes into the human population when a mosquito carrying the virus bites a human who has no immunity. The malaria parasite can remain for up to forty days in the blood of an infected person. The disease cannot be passed from person to person, unless a non-infected person is exposed to the blood of an infected person.

Question.create(text:"Due to an easing of state sanctions against hunting, Deersdale Preserve has experienced an influx of hunters in the last several months. During this time, the silvertail fox, a popular target for hunters, has seen a marked decrease in population.  Therefore, to prevent the population of silvertail fox—an important apex predator responsible for keeping the Deersdale County’s rabbit population in check—from falling even lower, the state should once again place strict sanctions against hunting.Which of the following, if true, may suggest that stricter sanctions against hunting would not have the desired effect?",answers: ["The population of rabbits has surged ever since the hunting sanctions in Deersdale County were lifted.","The silvertail fox population varies greatly throughout the year, especially during winter when prey becomes scarce."

Question.create(text: "The rate of health complications of patients on intravenous (IV) therapy at a particular hospital was higher than usual. Government inspectors found that the typical IV solutions used in this hospital had somewhat high concentrations of sodium and potassium, which were raising patients' blood pressure and taxing their kidneys. The government inspectors mandated lowering the sodium and potassium in these IV preparations, and threatened with a possible government fine.  In compliance, the hospital lowered the sodium and potassium levels in the IV solutions to the correct levels.  Nevertheless, patients on IV therapy at that hospital continued to have a high rate of health complications. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain why acting on the government inspectors' recommendations failed to achieve its goal?"
